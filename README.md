Problem Statement:
Baby Monkey needs to get back home before the sun sets. It would be great if he manages to pick up some fruits along the way for supper.

Solution:
Navigate Baby Monkey as he climbs the tree. Earn extra points by grabbing fruits along the way. 


User Stories:
- Press left and right key so that Baby Monkey knows which branch to grab
- There's a timer for each move, staying too long on each branch will make branch too heavy and cause Baby Monkey to fall from the branch.
- Earning a certain amount of points will allow Baby Monkey to proceed to the next level
- Start out as a sunny day and at each level, darken the background.
- Press space bar instead of the left and right key when there's fruits on the opposite branch


Things to think about:
- Beware of loose branches that might cause Baby Monkey to fall.
- Grabbing too many fruits that will slow Baby Monkey down
- Allow Baby Monkey to eat fruits while climbing to increase energy
- Enough energy will increase lives so that a mistake will let Baby Monkey drop levels but not lead to immediate death
- Level 1 is just to climb trees
- Level 2 is to grab fruits
- Level 3 can eat fruits to gain life and sustaining energy
- Level 4 avoid loose branches
